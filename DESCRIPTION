Description: The caretForecast package makes it easy to create conformal time 
  series forecasts using the caret infrastructure. The primary function ARml 
  provides access to state-of-the-art machine learning models for forecasting 
  applications. The hyperparameter of each model is selected based on time series
  cross-validation, and forecasting is done recursively.
